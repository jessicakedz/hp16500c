# This message is the one that is used if a bad stack pointer value is
# detected within our application on the PC.  Our experience has been that
# a bad stack pointer is the result of Windows' attempt to process the
# exception generated by a NULL pointer dereference.  Aside from flaws in
# our design, we have also seen this occur if the LAN driver was incorrectly
# installed and/or improperly configured when the PC was booted.

wormhole_0  = \\
A fatal application error has been detected.\\n\\
If this occurred while you were attempting\\n\\
to connect to the LAN, then verify that the\\n\\
Windows LAN device driver is correctly installed\\n\\
(perhaps the error is in your system.ini file).
