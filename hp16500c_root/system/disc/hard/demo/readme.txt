Readme file for the 16500C demo disk:

DEMO_1 files:

These files are demo files which demonstrate cross-domain
measurements and IMB triggering using stae, timing, and
analog measurements.

DEMO_1._C       16534_config
DEMO_1._E       16550A_config
DEMO_1.__       16500X config

Configuration as stored:

16534A in slot C
16550A in slot E

The IMB is used, so modules should be in the slots indicated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEMO_2 files:

These files are demo files for the 16522A pattern generator
and 16550A.

DEMO_2._D       16522_config
DEMO_2._E       16550A_config
FULL_CH.TXT     DOS

Configuration as stored:

16522A in slot D
16550A in slot E

The IMB is not used, so configs can be loaded into a 16522A
and a 16550A in any slot.

The file FULL_CH.TXT is a text file that can be used to load
vectors into the 16522A to demonstrate how this is done. This
file assumes a full-channel configuration for the 16522A.
